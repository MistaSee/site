# Mark Calleja Personal Site

Multi-page static site with a synthwave-inspired look.

## Quick Start
Open `index.html` in a browser or use any simple static server.

## Placeholders to Replace
- Page copy: `index.html`, `words.html`, `current-work.html`, `project-vault.html`, `chatbot-experiments.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`
- LinkedIn URL: update the `https://www.linkedin.com/` links on all pages
- Contact form: replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id` in `contact.html`

## Free Form Option (Recommended)
Formspree has a free tier and is easy to set up:
1. Create a form at https://formspree.io
2. Copy the generated endpoint (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/abc123xy`)
3. Paste it into `contact.html`

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push this project.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Set Source to `Deploy from a branch`.
4. Choose `main` and `/ (root)` and save.
5. Your site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

If you want to use your custom domain later, add it in the same Pages panel.
