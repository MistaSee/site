    Self-appointed rogue pedagogue. I generate the enthusiasm.
    The chaos is authentic. The human seems to be infected with some sort of data glitch he calls 'ADHD'.

            I design learning experiences for humans — especially the kind that get you building first,
            understanding second, and smiling the whole time.

            <p>
              I’m Mark Calleja (MrC). I work at the intersection of learning design, creative technology,
              and facilitation — turning computing concepts into projects people actually want to try.
              If there’s a way to make something clearer, kinder, and more playful, I will find it.
            </p>
            <p>
              My philosophy is simple: treat curiosity like a renewable resource, make the first step tiny
              and irresistible, and give learners permission to tinker. Think Mary Poppins’ “find the game”
              principle — but with more swearing (internally) and fewer referees.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve also been a Dungeons &amp; Dragons DM for 30 years, and I’m currently in year six of an
              ongoing weekly campaign. That long-form storytelling practice shapes how I teach and train:
              design for momentum, meet people where they are, reward creative risk-taking, and keep every
              session purposeful, collaborative, and memorable.

              <h3>Build first, explain later</h3>
              <p>
                I design activities that let people win quickly, then reverse‑engineer why it worked.
                It’s learning. It’s science. It’s a tiny bit of mischief.

              <h3>Engagement with teeth</h3>
              <p>
                Not “edutainment”. Just clear goals, meaningful choice, and that very specific joy
                of figuring something out.

              <h3>Collaboration, not commandments</h3>
              <p>
                I love working with educators, digital teams, brand folks, community volunteers,
                and anyone who cares about learners more than their own ego.
