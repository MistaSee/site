              <p>
                A secondary-level study coach and writing companion designed to
                improve thinking, not output. DraftPunk introduces productive
                friction: planning before writing, self-editing, structural
                clarity, and reflection. It deliberately avoids answer-dumping
                and is aligned with ethical assessment practice and exam
                literacy. It is anchored in the KS3 UK curriculum documents.

              <p>
                A Key Stage 2 learning and thinking coach, derived from DraftPunk
                but redesigned for younger learners. BrainBuddy focuses on
                confidence, encouragement, and gentle structure rather than
                critique. It helps pupils organise ideas, plan responses, and
                reflect on their thinking without doing the work for them.
                Tone-first, process-led, and developmentally appropriate. It is
                anchored in the KS2 UK curriculum documents.

              <p>
                A critical-friend GPT built to challenge weak reasoning, surface
                assumptions, and call out vagueness. Frankly does not comfort or
                validate by default; it interrogates ideas, tests logic, and
                pushes for clarity. It is explicitly anti-waffle and
                anti-sycophancy. Frankly does not play.

              <p>
                A prompting skills coach that teaches users how to work
                effectively with LLMs using the OCEAN framework (Objective,
                Context, Examples, Assess, Negotiate). Rather than generating
                prompts for users, it guides them through questioning,
                checklists, and reflection so the skill transfers beyond the
                tool itself rather than just having prompts be like magic tricks or incantations. Teaching you to fish, one prompt at a time.

              <p>
                AI-TA is a powerful AI Teaching Assistant designed to assist
                educators in managing their classrooms and enhancing their
                teaching experience. It offers a range of features including
                lesson planning, test creation, behaviour management advice, and
                more. It is grounded in the UK National Curriculum docs, Safeguarding and Data Protection advice.

              <p>
                A procedural text-based adventure generator, inspired by classic
                Zork-style games. AdventureMaster acts like a lightweight
                robotic DM, generating rooms, choices, and encounters
                dynamically based on user preferences and prior interactions.
                It is part game, part narrative engine, and part experiment in
                emergent storytelling.

              <p>
                A Socratic dialogue engine that probes beliefs through
                questioning rather than explanation. Plato's Ghost challenges
                certainty, introduces counter-examples, and forces users to
                articulate and defend their reasoning. It is designed to unsettle
                rather than reassure, and to interrogate everything. It strictly follows the Socratic method: 'Ask me questions til I get it.'

              <p>
                A playful AI assistant that takes your child’s doodles and instantly 
                creates photorealistic images or artistic renders, faithfully preserving 
                every quirky line, proportion, and imperfection. It applies lifelike 
                textures, lighting, and fitting environments without altering their 
                original creativity.

              <p>
                A philosophy translation experiment, designed to make high-brow
                ideas, particularly Stoicism, accessible through Aussie humour, blunt
                language, and relatable analogies. Built for learners alienated
                by formal education, it prioritises resonance over academic tone
                without dumbing down the underlying ideas.

              <p>
                ![Alt-Text](Bot) is a specialist AI with one job and a short leash: 
                writing high-quality, accessible image alt-text to best-practice standards. 
                It reviews images through an accessibility lens, picks out what matters, 
                and turns visuals into clear, screen-reader-friendly descriptions 
                under 125 characters. It sticks to strict rules on clarity, context, 
                punctuation, and UK English spelling: so every line is purposeful, 
                compliant, and never padded with fluff. Just paste or drop an image!

              <p>
                An early-generation thinking and writing scaffold, predating
                DraftPunk. Lexi focuses on helping users structure thoughts,
                explore first ideas, and engage in Socratic dialogue without
                writing on their behalf. It was a key experiment in introducing
                friction and resisting over-automation in LLM use.

                A world-building and D&D content engine built using a
                pseudocode-style prompting system written in plain English. It
                uses structured "functions" and slash commands stored in a
                knowledge document to generate lore, systems, and narrative
                artefacts. It is a serious experiment in pseudocode prompting
                and controllable creative generation.

                A plain-language copy editor focused on simplification and
                accessibility. Copybot analyses text for complexity and suggests
                alternatives using CEFR vocabulary lists (for example,
                B-level targets). It helps writers reduce cognitive load without
                losing meaning, particularly for educational or public-facing
                content.
