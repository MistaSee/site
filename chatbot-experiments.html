  <p>
    <span data-voice="normal">
      A secondary-level study coach and writing companion designed to
      improve thinking, not output. DraftPunk introduces productive
      friction: planning before writing, self-editing, structural
      clarity, and reflection. It deliberately avoids answer-dumping
      and is aligned with ethical assessment practice and exam
      literacy. It is anchored in the KS3 UK curriculum documents.

      A study coach that refuses to become your plagiarism butler.
      It makes you plan first, think in structure, and revise like a grown-up.
      If you ask it to “just write the answer,” it will respond by making you
      do the work you were hoping to dodge. Anchored in KS3. Powered by
      friction. You’re welcome.

  <p>
    <span data-voice="normal">
      A Key Stage 2 learning and thinking coach, derived from DraftPunk
      but redesigned for younger learners. BrainBuddy focuses on
      confidence, encouragement, and gentle structure rather than
      critique. It helps pupils organise ideas, plan responses, and
      reflect on their thinking without doing the work for them.
      Tone-first, process-led, and developmentally appropriate. It is
      anchored in the KS2 UK curriculum documents.
    </span>
    <span data-voice="rando" hidden>
      DraftPunk’s kinder sibling, designed for KS2 brains that are still
      growing their confidence scaffolding. It nudges, reassures, and
      structures thinking without taking over. No harsh critique. No smug
      “well actually.” Just enough support to keep them moving without
      stealing the win.

      A critical-friend GPT built to challenge weak reasoning, surface

      A GPT configured to withhold praise and interrogate your thinking.

    <span data-voice="normal">
      A prompting skills coach that teaches users how to work
      effectively with LLMs using the OCEAN framework (Objective,
      Context, Examples, Assess, Negotiate). Rather than generating
      prompts for users, it guides them through questioning,
      checklists, and reflection so the skill transfers beyond the
      tool itself rather than just having prompts be like magic tricks
      or incantations. Teaching you to fish, one prompt at a time.

    <span data-voice="rando" hidden>
      A framework designed to prevent you from treating me like a

      It exists so that your prompts stop sounding like spells

    <span data-voice="rando" hidden>
      A teaching assistant that handles the grind: planning, drafting,

      safeguarding, and data protection so it doesn’t wander off into
      fantasyland. It will help you move faster — but it expects you to

    <span data-voice="normal">
      A procedural text-based adventure generator, inspired by classic
      Zork-style games. AdventureMaster acts like a lightweight

      It is part game, part narrative engine, and part experiment in
      emergent storytelling.

    <span data-voice="rando" hidden>
      A lightweight robotic DM that can produce infinite corridors,

      It’s Zork-ish, procedural, and allergic to silence. It adapts to your
      choices and quietly judges your inventory management. Part game.

      certainty, introduces counter-examples, and forces users to
      articulate and defend their reasoning. It is designed to unsettle
