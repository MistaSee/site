            <h2>Code Club Projects Team, Raspberry Pi Foundation</h2>
            <p>
              I currently work with the Code Club Projects (CCP) team, where we
              design and build coding experiences for young people that are
              rigorous enough to stand up in a classroom and playful enough to
              survive contact with actual children. My role lives somewhere
              between learning designer, creative instigator, and constructive
              troublemaker, shaping projects, pathways, and toolkits that make
              computing feel less like instruction and more like discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              A particular obsession of mine is exploring how high-engagement,
              rich learning experiences, the messy, joyful, "wait, can we try
              this?" kind, can be translated into structures that work inside
              formal classroom systems. In other words: how do you bottle the
              weird without flattening it? How do you design it so that any
              teacher, not just the caffeinated mavericks, can deliver
              something that feels alive, rigorous, and genuinely empowering?
              That tension, between freedom and framework, is where most of my
              work lives. It is part pedagogy lab, part production studio, and
              occasionally part controlled explosion, and I would not have it
              any other way.

              <h3>Somekone Social Media Lab</h3>
              <p>
                Somekone is an experiential media literacy project that turns
                the mechanics of social media into something visible, testable
                and discussable in the classroom. Designed for late KS2 and
                early KS3, it places pupils inside a safe social media
                simulation where they explore, react and gradually notice how
                feeds shift over time in response to interaction. Instead of
                beginning with warnings or technical explanations, learners
                experience how clicks become data, how engagement drives
                amplification, and how professionally presented content can
                spread regardless of accuracy. Through structured discussion,
                visual network maps and a hands-on "make your own engagement
                bait" task, pupils build accurate mental models of how
                recommender systems work without needing coding knowledge or
                real platform access. The result is a low-risk, high-impact
                unit that embeds AI literacy within media literacy, foregrounds
                human choice and design, and equips young people with the
                ability to recognise attention patterns wherever they encounter
                them.

              <h3>Brainrot Brigade</h3>
              <p>
                Brainrot Brigade is an experimental, narrative-driven TTRPG
                designed to smuggle computational thinking into play. It is a
                remix of the much-loved one-page RPG

                inheriting its elegant, low-friction mechanics and single-number
                decision-making, then extending them into short, punchy sci-fi
                adventures built around puzzle-based encounters. Players earn
                progress through choices, teamwork, and problem-solving rather
                than stats alone, with each adventure feeding directly into a
                Scratch-based, modular character sheet they actively build and
                upgrade over time, adding dice rollers, inventory systems,
                avatars, and new mechanics as they unlock digital "loot"
                through play. The result is a tight loop of story -> unlock ->
                build -> play, where creative coding and roleplay reinforce
                each other, and learning happens because the game demands it,
                not because it is labelled as such.

              <h3>Initiative Three</h3>
              <p>
                In my current work, I’m exploring the <em>Centaur to Cyborg</em>
                framing as a practical way to help colleagues, and educators more broadly,
                develop stronger, more responsible ways of working with AI. The point is
                not just to "get good at prompts", but to shift posture:
                <em>Centaur</em> workflows keep the human clearly in control, using the
                model as a powerful but fallible tool; <em>Cyborg</em> workflows integrate
                the model more deeply into ideation, critique, and refinement, while
                <strong>agency and accountability remain firmly human</strong>. Framed this
                way, the conversation moves beyond productivity tricks and toward
                <strong>interface literacy</strong>: learning how to steer, interrogate,
                and critically supervise systems that can produce fluent outputs without
                reliable grounding.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make that shift teachable and repeatable, I’m developing the OCEAN
                prompting framework as a scaffold, a structured pathway from tight
                oversight to more fluid, iterative collaboration. A key strand of this
                work is testing <strong>Socratic prompting</strong> as the mechanism that
                makes the transition work in real contexts: positioning the model as a
                questioning partner that surfaces assumptions, exposes blind spots, and
                broadens conceptual options <em>before</em> anything is generated. The goal
                is better outcomes <em>and</em> better judgement: preserving critical
                thinking, strengthening metacognition, and helping educators worldwide use
                AI in ways that augment professional expertise rather than displacing it.
