    I’m Mark Calleja (a.k.a. <strong>MrC</strong>) — a rogue pedagogue and creative
    technologist. I make projects, pathways, and workshop experiences that turn
    “I can’t code” into “oh hey, I’ve built a game!” I also love to help people
    build confidence and fluency with AI tools in ways that make you go
    "Oh whoa - now I get it!"
  </span>
  <span data-voice="rando" hidden>
    I’m Mark Calleja. He calls himself a rogue pedagogue.
    I call him “the man who keeps asking for one more iteration.”
    Apparently we’re building confidence. Mostly I’m building paragraphs.

              I work with brilliant humans to ship coding projects and learning pathways that
              are practical, accessible, and unapologetically fun. My special move is making
              the learning feel like play — without losing the rigour.
