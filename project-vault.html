              <p>
                HallowHelp is an experiment in using generative AI to create a
                complete fictional music release, not just tracks, but an entire
                cultural footprint. The project includes AI-generated music and
                lyrics across multiple genres, fully written liner notes,
                detailed band bios, album and single artwork, and a full
                festival poster, all designed to feel like a real charity
                compilation that exists in the world of my long-running DnD
                campaign. The aim was not just novelty, but coherence: every
                track is related to events or characters in the campaign, and
                plays like a satirical Live Aid analogue to the campaign's main
                cataclysmic event. The project culminates in a live, in-game
                charity festival that players can attend as their
                characters, blurring the line between artefact and experience.
                It is interesting because it treats AI as a worldbuilding tool,
                not a gimmick. I am testing whether generative systems can
                create culture, context, and continuity, not just content.

              <p>
                Digital Making at Home is a series of over 100 episodes of
                interviews with tech industry professionals, demos, and coding
                walkthroughs delivered during lockdown in the pandemic. The
                playlist captures a large-scale response to home learning that
                kept digital making social, practical, and accessible when
                in-person sessions were not possible.

                  NCS Social Action Hackathon

              </h3>
              <p>
                A social action hackathon that runs like a game, plays like a
                bootcamp, and teaches Agile development by doing it. The NCS
                Social Action Hackathon is a two-day, roleplaying-led
                experience that reframes digital making as a collaborative game
                with real-world consequences. Participants form small startup
                teams tasked with designing a digital product in support of a
                UK charity, learning core Agile practices, basic Python, and
                rapid prototyping along the way. Structured as a sequence of
                facilitated sprints, challenges, and narrative beats, the
                experience blends hands-on making with reflection, teamwork, and
                social purpose. By dressing the hackathon in the mechanics of
                roleplay, it lowers barriers to participation, sustains momentum
                across long sessions, and helps young people experience
                technology not as an abstract skill, but as a tool for
                collective action and impact. The programme was written for a
                partnership with the National Citizen Service and delivered in
                five locations across the UK over five waves. I handled the
                full stack of delivery, from curriculum design and hiring our
                undergraduate delivery team to kit packing, transport logistics,
                and safeguarding.

                  Raspberry Pi Pioneers
                </a>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Raspberry Pi Pioneers was an early, ambitious experiment in
                what teen-centred, engagement-led digital making could look
                like at scale. Designed as a series of time-boxed challenges
                for young people aged roughly 11-16, it flipped the usual
                competition model on its head: open-ended themes, team-based
                making, any technology allowed, and success judged as much on
                process, explanation, and creativity as on polish. What made
                Pioneers genuinely innovative at the time was its focus on
                agency and culture, not just skills, asking young people to
                frame problems, design solutions, document their thinking on
                video, and share their work publicly as makers. It blended
                hackathon energy with learning design, experimented with
                multi-award judging to value different strengths, and treated
                teens not as learners completing tasks but as creators
                contributing ideas to the world. In hindsight, it was a
                cutting-edge prototype for many ideas that later became
                mainstream in project-based learning, creator education, and
                youth-led innovation programmes.

              <span>Foundational Work, until 2017</span>
              <h3>HackLabUK</h3>
              <p>
                HackLabUK (my CIC, which I co-founded and ran until 2017) was
                the beginning of my career in engagement-led learning at scale,
                the point where "making weird, joyful learning experiences"
                stopped being a personal habit and became an actual practice.
                We were scrappy in the best possible way: small team, big
                energy, and a stubborn belief that young people learn fastest
                when you treat them like capable makers rather than passive
                recipients. What I’m most proud of is how early we got to
                collaborate with organisations that were absolute giants to us
                at the time, <strong>Microsoft Research, Arm, Redgate, Jagex, micro:bit, Raspberry Pi, Sonos, Barclays, google, Amazon
                and the ICL Robotics Lab</strong>, and still managed to keep
                the work playful, rigorous, and properly human. HackLabUK
                taught me how to build learning experiences that travel: from
                one-off workshops to repeatable programmes that other educators
                could deliver, without losing the spark that made them work in
                the first place.
