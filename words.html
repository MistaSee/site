                From Blank Page to Brilliance: The OCEAN Approach to LLM Prompting, 
                presents a practical, step-by-step framework that helps educators 
                and professionals use large language models with clarity and confidence. 
                By structuring prompts into five purposeful stages—Objective, Context, 
                Examples, Assess, and Negotiate—it turns what can feel like a messy, 
                unpredictable exchange into a repeatable, ethical, and human-centred 
                process. Grounded in research and real-world use, OCEAN improves 
                output quality while strengthening accountability, transparency, 
                and critical oversight - positioning AI as a collaborator that extends 
                human capability, not replaces it.

                  OCEAN Prompting Process

              </h3>
              <p>
                The OCEAN Prompting process is a structured guide to
                effectively using Large Language Models (LLMs) for co-authoring
                content. The acronym stands for Objective (defining your
                goal), Personas (shaping the model's communication style),
                Context (providing necessary background, tone, and specific
                details), Examples (offering one-shot, few-shot, or many-shot
                examples to guide the output), Assess (checking the output for
                accuracy, bias, and adherence to goals), and Negotiate
                (conversational refinement of the results). The process
                emphasizes the user's responsibility to ensure the final
                output's quality, accuracy, and alignment with organizational
                principles, culminating in a mandatory Final Step: Human Edit
                before submission.

              <p>
                This article captures a hackathon where young Scouts used tech
                to tackle real social challenges, highlighting how computing
                skills can connect with community issues and empower meaningful
                creative problem-solving. It also shows how roleplay, teamwork,
                and rapid prototyping can turn technical learning into
                purposeful action, with young people designing practical ideas
                for real-world impact.

                  Project-based learning: a path to agency

              </h3>
              <p>
                Project-based learning: a path to agency makes the case that
                the most powerful learning happens when the project is the unit.
                By asking students to design solutions to real problems,
                learning emerges through investigation, iteration, and making,
                rather than assessment-first activities. The piece shows how
                agency increases engagement, builds transferable skills, and
                reframes the teacher's role from delivering answers to enabling
                discovery, with practical examples drawn from hackathons and
                classroom-ready resources.
